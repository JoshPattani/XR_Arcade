## Project Description

A small fishing village has been invaded by terrorizing creatures that have taken over the fishing grounds. The fishing towers are now too dangerous for the town’s fishermen to catch fish, and the village is getting scarce on food. Luckily, one of the anglers in the village is also a highly skilled archer and has volunteered to risk his life to save the town.

In this Tower Defense arcade game, players will shoot and catch as many jumping fish as possible with arrows from the fishing towers. Even armed with a bow, the archers aren’t safe and must stay vigilant. The water monsters have been known to destroy entire fishing towers, taking fishermen down with them. Players must protect the towers and the fishermen at all costs. Work to catch fish to feed the village, upgrade towers, and kill all the creatures before they destroy the fishing towers.
